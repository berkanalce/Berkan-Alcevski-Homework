    At age 11 Beckham won a football contest, and as a teenager he competed on Manchester United's youth squad, leading it to a national championship in 1992. Three years later he began playing with the professional team in league competition, and during the 1995-96 season he helped Manchester United win the league title and the Football Association (FA) Cup. Beckham attracted national attention in August 1996 when he scored a goal from the halfway line (a feat roughly equivalent to a golfer's hole in one). The following year Manchester United successfully defended its league title, and Beckham was voted Young Player of the Year. In the 1998-99 season Manchester United won the league title, the FA Cup, and the European Cup. Beckham was named best midfielder and Most Valuable Player. Considered one of the sport's elite players, he was perhaps best known for his free kicks and crosses; the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham paid homage to his kicking ability. After helping Manchester United win three more league titles (2000, 2001, and 2003), he left the team in 2003 to join the Spanish football club Real Madrid. Four years later he signed a record-setting deal with the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States. In October 2008 Beckham signed to play with Italian football powerhouse AC Milan during the MLS off-season. In 2011 he helped the Galaxy win an MLS Cup title. The Galaxy won a second MLS Cup title in 2012, and Beckham left the team at the end of the season. In 2013 he joined the French first-league team Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and PSG won the French domestic title in his one season with the team. </div>

    Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as Ronaldinho Ga√∫cho (Brazilian Portuguese: or simply Ronaldinho,is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but was also deployed as a winger. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldinho won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. A global icon of the sport, he was renowned for his technical skills, creativity, dribbling ability and accuracy from free-kicks, his use of tricks, feints, no-look passes and overhead kicks, as well as his ability to score and create goals, all prominent characteristics of his early-age background playing futsal.

    Ronaldinho made his career debut for Gr√™mio, in 1998. At age 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award as Barcelona won the 2004-05 La Liga title. The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning the 2005-06 UEFA Champions League, their first in fourteen years, and another La Liga title, giving Ronaldinho his first career double, receiving the 2005 Ballon d'Or and his second FIFA World Player of the Year in the process. After scoring two spectacular solo goals in the first 2005-06 El Cl√°sico, Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernab√©u.
    
    Following a second-place La Liga finish to Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season and an injury-plagued 2007-08 season, Ronaldinho suffered a decline in his performances‚Äîoften put down to a decrease in dedication and focus having achieved so much in the sport‚Äîand departed Barcelona to join AC Milan, where he won the 2010-11 Serie A. He returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atl√©tico Mineiro a year later where he won the 2013 Copa Libertadores, before moving to Mexico to play for Quer√©taro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015. Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career: he was included in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times each, and was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year for the 2005-06 season and South American Footballer of the Year in 2013; in 2004, he was named by Pel√© in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.</div>
